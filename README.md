	- set the book content icon, i.e. if a book has been downloaded locally.  (default: üìò)

	- set search scope (default: 'Title')

<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>

- launch with keyword (default: `!k`), or custom hotkey
- `enter` ‚Ü©Ô∏è will open the book in Kindle (if downloaded) or the corresponding webpage on Amazon (if not downloaded)




<h1 id="known-issues">Limitations & known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>

- None for now, but I have not done extensive testing, let me know if you see anything!
- tested with ~100 books. The book list is currently created on the fly, and book covers are downloaded if missing. Might be slower if your library has thousands of books, in which case a sqlite database it might be more efficient. Let me know if that is the case! 
- tested with Python 3.9.13
